# CSS modeller
Simple frontend web application for prototyping, modelling and trying out stuff in CSS.

## How it works
This app allows you to use predefined element templates, modify its CSS properties and move them around in the CSS hierarchy by applying changes to the DOM of the model. You can also download your creations or load already made models.

## How to run
1. One of the libraries used requires the app has to run on a webserver, so make sure you have access to one.
2. Download [the latest release](https://github.com/VaclavPilat/CSS-modeller/releases/latest).
3. Move unzipped files to the webserver location.
4. Locate and run file `index.html` in a browser.
